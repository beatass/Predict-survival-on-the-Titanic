# Predict survival on the Titanic

We are going to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the Titanic tragedy.

## Motivation

In this study the exploratory analysis (EDA) with visualizations of the Titanic's cruise passengers dataset as well as a different ML algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, KNN, Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision Tree and Random Forest have been performed to make a relevant predictions.

#### The project is created with Python libraries:

 -  scikit-learn/pandas/numpy.

### Recap


#### Running the project:

* To run this project use Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

## Files in this repository

## The dataset origin

The dataset can be found at Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) and contains data about information on Titanic's cruise passengers.

## Relevant information

The dataset consists of the following features:

- PassengerId - A numerical id assigned to each passenger;
- Survived - Whether the passenger survived (1), or didn't (0). It is ours target variable;
- Pclass - Ticket class (1st = Upper, 2nd = Middle, 3rd = Lower);
- Name - The name of the passenger;
- Sex - The gender of the passenger (male or female);
- Age - The age of the passenger;
- SibSp - number of siblings (brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister) / spouses (husband, wife [mistresses and fianc√©s were ignored]) aboard the Titanic;
- Parch - number of parents (mother, father) / children (daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson) aboard the Titanic. Note: Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them;
- Ticket - The ticket number of the passenger;
- Fare - How much the passenger paid for the ticker;
- Cabin - Cabin number;
- Embarked - Where the passenger boarded the Titanic Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).
